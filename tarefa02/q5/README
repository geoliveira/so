Instructions for running RMI source code examples.
--------------------------------------------------

This is organized into three directories:

(1) client - which contains the Client code.

(2) server - which contains the RemoteFunc interface and implementation.

(3) rmi-callback - which provides an example of performing an RMI callback (this is an example that is not in the text.) A callback allows the server to invoke a remote method on the client.

Compilation instructions for the rmi-callback example are contained in the README in the rmi-callback directory.

To run the remote date  files

SERVER
------
1. Compile all source files.

2. Generate the stub and skeleton class files using RMIC (This is only necessary for those using
pre-Java 5.0 compilers.)

	rmic RemoteFuncImpl

3. Start the registry (rmiregistry)

On UNIX/Linux/OS X, enter

	rmiregistry &

On Windows, enter

	start rmiregistry

4. Create the remote object 

	java RemoteFuncImpl

This registers the remote date on the server with the RMI registry.

CLIENT
------

*** Make sure the files RemoteFunc.class and RemoteFuncImpl_Stub.class are in the client directory!!!

1. Compile RemoteFunc.java

2. Start the client

	java Client


It is possible to have the server download the class files to the client. For
details how to do this, please consult the RMI homepage at
